## About this app:

This is an online learning portal developed based on PHP and JavaScript mainly. It allows teachers to create online courses and have students join who are interested. It also allows teachers to upload course videos, course materials, and conduct quizzes as well. Students on the other hand, can watch the videos, materials, and can actively participate in the quizzes and can also raise queries to the teacher within the course. This portal allows students to learn new concepts with the help of the courses designed by the teacher.
